<h4 align="center">Build, test, and use Stripe inside your editor.</h4>

Stripe's extension for Visual Studio Code makes it easy to generate sample code, view API request logs, forward events to your application, and use Stripe within your editor.

A new Stripe panel in the activity bar provides easy access to code snippets for several languages, adds debug configurations, and extends the command palette with common developer workflows.

## Telemetry

The Stripe VS Code Extension collects basic telemetry in order to improve this extension's experience.
