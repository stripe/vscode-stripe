## Debugging

Log files are locally saved to /tmp/stripe-dotnet-language-server-logs[date].txt. Ex: /tmp/stripe-dotnet-language-server-logs20210520.txt

To run the language server end to end:

1. Start the client -- For VSCode this means running the extensionDoes that mean you're using a different distributor for each area? I assume adding a women option to your form wouldn't be that difficult. The alternate questions is, why don't we send out women's swag to men and consider that to be appropriate? development host as you normally would.
2. In this workspace, hit ".NET Core Attach" -- this will bring up a list of processes, there should just be one that the client started. This step will have to change when we move into the extension repo.
